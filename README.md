# Python-stuff
My python stuff from 6th to 8th grade. Some are in Finnish, some are in English. I have a lot more projects, but they are really bad. I have made most of these in tiedekoulu on 6th/7th grade. 

Binaryclock: Adds the inputted number every second to the previous number in binary. \n
Jakojaannos: Basically just x % y
Multiplication table: Prints x * y  z times adding 1 to y every time (x * y, x * y+1, x * y+2...)
Piin_koodi: Creates a pin-code with probabilities taken from the occurrance of numbers in the first thousand digits of pi every time you press enter.
Potential energy calculator: Calculates gravitational potential energy (mgh)
Tiedekoulu_enemy: Pygame game that I made when I was studying pygame in tiedekoulu
binaari: Turns decimal number to binary number and vice verca.
emc2: Calculates E=MC^2 
encryption: Really bad encryption script
keskiarvo.pt: Calculates the average of inputted numbers
keskiarvo: It should be called "Arvosanalaskuri.py" but I'm too lazy. It calculates what grade the student will get from a test.

= Quite basic stuff.
